How to Use
Step-by-Step Guide
Download and Open the Files: Download all necessary files and ensure they are in the same directory:

index.html - The main webpage file.
style.css - The styling file for the webpage.
script.js - The file containing JavaScript functionality.
Enter Monster Information:

Open the index.html file in your browser.
Fill in the text fields for Monster(s), Tier, Type, Difficulty, Attack Modifier, and more. These fields allow you to customize each monster you are managing.
Track HP and Stress:

Click on the small boxes under the HP and Stress sections. Each click will toggle the fill of the box, allowing you to track the current HP and stress levels of the monster.
Roll Dice:

Adjust the dice counter using the "+" or "-" buttons next to each die image. These allow you to keep track of the number of dice rolled for that monster's action.
Upload Monster or Character Image:

Under the Features section, use the "Upload Character Image" button to upload a monster or character image. Once an image is selected, it will display in the dedicated area.
Save Progress:

You can update and change any monster's information as you go. However, the site does not have a save state feature, so make sure to manually note any important details if closing the browser.
File Structure
index.html: The core structure of the webpage.
style.css: This file provides all the necessary styling to ensure the page looks clean and functional.
script.js: Handles dynamic actions like dice rolling, HP/Stress box toggling, and image uploading.
Setup Instructions
Ensure all files (index.html, style.css, script.js, and images) are in the same folder.
Open the index.html file in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Begin using the tool by filling out the monster data, rolling dice, and uploading character images.
Customization
You can easily customize the CSS in style.css to fit your preferred color schemes or font styles.
The JavaScript in script.js is well-commented, allowing you to add new dice types or modify the logic behind HP and stress tracking.
Notes
The tool is fully client-side, meaning no data is sent or stored on a server. Be sure to manually keep track of game data if you refresh the page or close your browser.
The dice rolling mechanic does not generate actual random numbers; it is merely a visual tracker for the number of dice being rolled.
Future Enhancements
Add a feature for rolling actual dice and outputting the results directly.
Implement a save state option to preserve monster stats and progress across sessions.
Enjoy running your RPG sessions smoothly with the  Monster Hub!
